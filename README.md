# Classification-of-the-position-of-object-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Hi  my name is Vrushank Dhande. I am student inn engineering college. I am doing Eletronic Engineering. 
I am interseted in coding part. The main is in the machine learning and deep learning alogrithms.

***THIS PROJECT**
The project consist the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
The is created by single person. The was created by recording number of videos of the object with different direct like top, bottom right, bottom left, top right and top left.
The videos then converted to images and in perticular folder. Per folder contain about 1500 images and total images 7500.
Then the data was preprossed as the image size was to big, thus the GPU used to get lover load. 
The problem was faced was of the angle, then the code was written for changing the angle and the was saved again to google drive.
Dated was created to team as x(images) and team as y(lablws).
The data is feeded to the CNN alogrithem in which very cases are then in consideration for greated accuracy.
thr result which is given by the model was 0.9975.
