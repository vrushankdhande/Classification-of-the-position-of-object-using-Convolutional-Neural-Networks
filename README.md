# Classification-of-the-position-of-object-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Hi  my name is Vrushank Dhande. 
***THIS PROJECT**
The project consists of the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
This project is entirely processed or runs on the online source IDE. The online IDE is Google Colaboratory. 
The is created by a single person. Then the entire data was upload to google drive for giving the path to Google Colab.
The was created by recording a number of videos of the object with different directions like a top, bottom right, bottom left, top right and top left.
The videos then converted to images and in particular folders. Per folder contain about 1500 images and total images 7500.
Then the data were preprocessed as the image size was too big, thus the GPU used to get lover load. 
The problem that was faced was the angle, then the code was written for changing the angle and the was saved again to google drive.
Dated was created to the team as x(images) and the team as y(labels).
The data is fed to the CNN algorithm in which very cases are then in consideration for greater accuracy.
The result which is given by the model was 0.9975.
